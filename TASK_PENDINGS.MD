# Pending Tasks

- [ ] Install project dependencies using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` so Jest and ESLint work locally and in CI.
- [x] Configure CI pipeline to execute `npm test` after installing dependencies.
- [ ] Expand unit test coverage for components and pages (only ThemeProvider has tests currently).
- [ ] Fix existing ESLint errors and remove `any` types and unused variables.
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests using a framework such as Playwright or Cypress.
- [x] Document environment variables in the README for easier local setup.
- [x] Provide Docker usage instructions and ensure docker-compose works out of the box.
- [x] Add a service worker/manifest to provide offline capabilities (PWA).
- [x] Add French translations to support an additional language.
- [ ] Review Firebase security rules and deployment process documentation.
- [ ] Provide data import/export features or backups for user data.
